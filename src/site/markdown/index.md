# nom-tam-fits

The pure Java library for reading and writing FITS files. FITS, the Flexible Image Transport System, is the format commonly used in the archiving and transport of astronomical data.

This is the original library from http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/fits/java/ ported to maven and published to the central repo by the original developers!

The HEASARC site will still be periodically updated with release versions, but the latest code should always be here.
